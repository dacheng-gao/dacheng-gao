## Hi it's Dacheng :)

There are some things I'm familar with:
- Building applications using dotnet, java, php.
- Database design and development using mysql, sqlserver.
- Linux server administration and cloud services like aws, azure, alibaba cloud.
- CI/CD pipeline using github actions, jenkins, gitea.

My beliefs:
- Solve real problems.
- What you get from learning is more important than what you have learnt.
- Start small and build step by step.
- Build something you love.

I'm interested in:
- Learn zig and build something with it.
- Learn dotnet runtime details and how to optimize the performance and memory usage.
- Learn coroutine and async io for better scalability.
