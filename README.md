I'm familar with:
- Building applications using dotnet, java, php.
- Database design and development using mysql, sqlserver.
- Linux server administration and cloud services like aws, azure, alibaba cloud.
- CI/CD pipeline using github actions, jenkins, gitea.

I'm interested in:
- learn and use zig/c, csharp/dotnet, php/python, js/ts.
- languages internals.
- async io and io multiplexing.
- user-space thread: coroutines.
- multi-thread programming.
- socket programming.
- network protocols.
- distributed computing.
- data structure and algorithm.
- operating system.

My beliefs:
- Solve real problems.
- What you get from learning is more important than what you have learnt.
- Start small and build step by step.
- Build something you love.
